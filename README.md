# My Personal Blog

Using skeleton code from the default Gatsby starter.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

This is a work in progress but the end result will be a blog to document my travels, review mountaineering gear, and offer trail guides.
